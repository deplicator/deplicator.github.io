<h3 id="prairie-view-a-m-small-_bachelors-in-computer-science_-2012-2016-small-">Prairie View A&amp;M <small><em>Bachelors in Computer Science</em> <strong>2012 - 2016</strong></small></h3>
<p>I lead my senior design team to build a web based multi-player space combat game. The server side
was Node.js, Socket.io, and MongoDB; while the client side used Phaser.io for the game engine along
with the usual Bootstrap and jQuery to make it pretty.</p>
<p>As a research assistant I built a ticket system to help the Provost&#39;s Office process student
requests. It was made with an MVC (Backbone.js), a PHP API (Slim), and a ton of documentation
because someone else would be taking it over.</p>
<p>While working for the <a href="http://www.pvamu.edu/include/Computer_Science/cloudgroup.pdf">Cloud Computing Research Group</a> I made a web interface to spare image
processing users from the command line. The backend was a Hadoop Cluster and we visualized the data
with D3.</p>
<p>I got a degree too.</p>

<p>I was part of a crack team of interns that pulled a bunch of complicated data from multiple
databases and visualized it in the coolest way possible. This was the first time I made extensive
use of Visual Studios and the .NET Framework. It has it&#39;s pros and cons.</p>
<p>I also setup a Wiki for internal documentation saving employee&#39;s time because it was quick for
finding information and easy to maintain. It was the first time I set up PHP on IIS, and used a
MSSQL database instead of MySQL. They really like Microsoft at HP.</p>
<h3 id="l3-communications-small-_software-development-internship_-summer-of-2013-small-">L3 Communications <small><em>Software Development Internship</em> <strong>Summer of 2013</strong></small></h3>
<p>I got this internship because I already knew Linux and Git. Every morning I drove past Rocket park
to build a user friendly interface that tested the on-board computer of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft)">Orion Multi-Purpose
Crew Vehicle</a>, making life a little easier for some NASA engineers. It was so cool.</p>
<p>It was also my first experience with Node.js and I used so much jQuery I no longer have to look up
how to use most methods.</p>
<h3 id="lone-star-university-small-_student_-2010-2011-small-">Lone Star University <small><em>Student</em> <strong>2010 - 2011</strong></small></h3>
<p>Graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> and I hope they don&#39;t take it away for having to look up what it meant.</p>

<p>My role was to make sure customers were satisfied and the company profited. There was a lot of
troubleshooting involved--ran into many interesting problems. Learned I enjoy helping people more
than fixing computers.</p>

<p>Most of my time was spent in warehouse management and administrative work, but teaching fellow
Marines to <a href="https://www.cool.navy.mil/usmc/enlisted/5711.htm" title="The job title has changed from NBC to CBRN sometime after 2003.">survive in contaminated environments</a> was a rewarding role.</p>
