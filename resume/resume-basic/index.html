<h3 id="prairie-view-a-m">Prairie View A&amp;M</h3>
<p><em>Bachelors in Computer Science / Student Employee</em><br><strong>2012 - 2016</strong></p>
<p>My senior design project was a multi-player HTML5 space combat game. In addition to a degree, I created a web interface for the <a href="http://www.pvamu.edu/include/Computer_Science/cloudgroup.pdf">Cloud Computing Research Group</a> to spare users from the command line. I also built a ticket system to help the Provost&#39;s Office process student requests.</p>
<pre><meter value="0.9127"></meter> <-- earning bachelors 91.27%</pre>

<h3 id="hewlett-packard-enterprise">Hewlett Packard Enterprise</h3>
<p><em>Software Development Internship</em><br><strong>Summer of 2015</strong></p>
<p>Setup a Wiki for internal documentation saving employee&#39;s time because it was a fast way to find information and easy to maintain.</p>
<h3 id="l3-communications">L3 Communications</h3>
<p><em>Software Development Internship</em><br><strong>Summer of 2013</strong>  </p>
<p>Built a user friendly interface to tests the on-board computer of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft)">Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle</a>, making life a little better for some NASA engineers.</p>
<h3 id="lone-star-university">Lone Star University</h3>
<p><em>Student</em><br><strong>2010 - 2011</strong>  </p>
<p>Graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> and I hope they don&#39;t take it away for having to look up what it meant.</p>
<h3 id="sidtek-l-l-c-">Sidtek, L.L.C.</h3>
<p><em>Head Computer Repair Technician</em><br><strong>2003 - 2008</strong>  </p>
<p>My role was to make sure customers were satisfied and the company profited. There was also a lot of troubleshooting involved--ran into many interesting problems. Learned I enjoy helping people more than fixing computers.</p>
<h3 id="united-states-marine-corps">United States Marine Corps</h3>
<p><em>Sergeant - Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Warfare Defense Specialist</em><br><strong>1998 - 2003</strong>  </p>
<p>Most of my time was spent in warehouse management and administrative work, but teaching fellow Marines to <a href="https://www.cool.navy.mil/usmc/enlisted/5711.htm" title="The job title has changed from NBC to CBRN sometime after 2003.">survive in contaminated environments</a> was the most rewarding role.</p>
