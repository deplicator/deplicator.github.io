                    <h2>Habits</h2>
                    <p><img src="https://deplicator.github.io/images/habit-guy.png" alt="That sword looks a little too big." title="No doubt, the world of Habitaria fears the might of a level 4 habit builder and his magic helmet."></p>
<p>I admit, the primary point of this post is to keep my resolution of one post per month. It seems
like an easy goal; until finals. <em>Warning: this post contains a bit of personal junk</em>.</p>
<p>On that note, I find personal productivity (and tracking it) an interesting field. If my RSS reader
is a metric of any kind, there are a lot of people interested in it. It makes sense, we&#39;re all
selfish to some extent and personal productivity is all about ourselves.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Some years ago I read <a href="https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits.php">7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>. I&#39;m leery of book titles with
numbers and &#39;ly&#39; words in the title, but it remains the only book I&#39;ve ever recommended to others.
It was the book that made me realize I can learn how successful people do things. I still need to
refine it, and practice it, and make it work for me; but I&#39;m not starting from scratch (<em>note: more
proof we are living in a cool future</em>).</p>
<p>I don&#39;t consider myself a success, but I feel like I&#39;m finally on the right path. Over the years
I&#39;ve used a number of tools to aid me in being a productive or successful person. I think many of
us struggle with what works for our tastes.</p>
<p>For me, the task managing tool I use most is the one in gmail (you know that one no one knows about
and almost doesn&#39;t make sense it&#39;s even in there). When I am not at home I can add to it from my
email account. When I am at home I use this link to manage the list.</p>
<p><a href="https://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas">mail.google.com/tasks/canvas</a></p>
<p>I don&#39;t recall where I found it, or why it exists, or when Google will take it away (RIP Reader). I
like it though. I don&#39;t even bother with separate lists, just one big list. For example I&#39;ll have
stuff like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>COMP3223 - Assignment 3 due</li>
<li>COMP3053 - Group Project due</li>
<li>Research Group - Setup bitbucket repo</li>
<li>Personal - taxes</li>
<li>Personal - look into dropbox alternatives</li>
</ul>
<p>I generally group them by what comes before the hyphen, but I can also sort by due date. Tasks can
be edited like one big text document, and you can add notes to a specific task. The only thing
simpler would be a text document (which I&#39;ve been known to use but it not as satisfying to delete
tasks as it is to check them off and see the line through them).</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I started using <a href="https://habitrpg.com/">habitrpg.com</a>. It also has a task list with
satisfying checkboxes, and it&#39;s kind of fun. I&#39;ve particularly enjoyed the daily tasks, I have a bad
habit of skipping breakfast. Since I&#39;ve started using HabitRPG I have yet to miss breakfast.</p>
<p>Time will tell how well I stick to this one, but so far it is more promising than many of the other
tools I&#39;ve used. It caters to the gamified desire for immediate feedback. Just the other day I was
so close to level 3, I did a <a href="http://projecteuler.net/problems">Project Euler</a> problem (which is one of my regular habits)
just to level up.</p>
<p>If this post has a point to make, it is try new stuff. I hear a lot of people say &quot;Have a system and
stick to it.&quot; I feel that is bad advice. I say stick with what works, but don&#39;t let that stop you
from checking out everything else.</p>
